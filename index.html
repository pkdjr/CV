    <p>I am a student at Hindustan University. My research focuses on algorithms and networks, the roles they play in
        large-scale social and information systems, and their broader societal implications. My work has been supported
        by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation
        Fellowship, a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and
        grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. </p>

    <h3>Books and Teaching</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In 2021 and 2022, Karen Levy and I taught a new course entitled Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO
            1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a
            range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.</li>
        <li>Im currently pursuing Commputer Science Engineering in the worst college one can imagine. </li>
        <li>I had met a girl named Leah</li>
        <li>We've been dating for the past 5 months.</li>
